								<h2 class="text-block__h">Feels A Lot More Than Good 🤪</h2>
								<p class="text-block__p">Being with you feels like I'm with a child, a peer, a mom & a grandma at the same time. This might be the reason why I'm this much addicted to you. To put you before everything I have & I believe. I actually feel like you're everything that I wanted my partner to be + a lottt more 🌝. It's so comfortable being with you cus I can tell you anything knowing that I won't be judged. I think being honest with each other is the main thing that keeps us going 😗</p>

								<h2 class="text-block__h">I Want To Promise You. But... 😅</h2>
								<p class="text-block__p">I want to make a promise with you to not make you cry or upset ever again. But I won't because I know that I can't keep that promise. It's because my DUMBASS is still learning about relationships and the best way it learns is by fucking up things. So if I ever do anything again like that, just remember it's becoming I'm a DUMBASS & just remember that I would never have bad intentions with you 😊. I know it's so immature & irresponsible for me to say something like this. But that's the truth about me. Keep that in your mind 😬</p>

								<h2 class="text-block__h">First I was thinking about giving you something handmade with papers, something like a card. But then I changed my mind and made this. And there's also a little gift for you in the RIGHT SIDE POCKET of your bag 🐨. Thank you for being with me. LOVE YOU LOTSSS 😘 </h2>

								<h2 class="text-block__h">You Are So Sooo Amazing ☺️</h2>
								<p class="text-block__p">Even though I say it all the time, I still don't know actually why I say it. But deep down I believe that you are amazing. Maybe it's because you look me after, care about me like no one does & also maybe because you make me angry equally so 😄. But no matter what, I feel like you're the perfect one for me. The girl who's pretty, smart, cute, kind, innocent, good and just weird enough to be with me ✨

								<p class="text-block__p">Yep. I'm sorry. Sorry for everything I have done to make you cry & upset up until now, for everything I have done knowingly or unknowingly. And I'm also sorry if I have ever broken your trust and expectations. And I'm also sorry for not being with you in the moments that you need me the most 😖. But I never wanted to anything wrong with you. I know that you know that. I also know that you know that I know that you know that 😅. Accept my sincere apologies.</p>
